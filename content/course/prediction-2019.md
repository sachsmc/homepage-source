# Learning Objectives

1. Understand how predictions differ from associations
2. Understand the term "machine learning" and its role in medical research
3. Describe a predictive model, comparing and contrasting single-variable and multi-variable models
4. Name and recognize common measures of predictive accuracy
5. Understand the difference between in-sample and out-of-sample prediction
6. Be aware of terminology related to prediction models in medical research
7. Identify problems related to overfitting in the development of a predictive model
8. List statistical strategies to avoid overfitting and overoptimisim bias
